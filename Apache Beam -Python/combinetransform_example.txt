[1,10,20,40,50,9] 
counts = 6

Coventional combiners cannot calculate correct results for a mean or division of numbers.
1+10+20+40+50+9/6 = 130/6 = 21.667


[1,40,10] = 51/3 = 17

						= (17+26.3)/2 => 21.65
[20,50,9] = 79/3 = 26.3

But beam combiners can provide correct results for these calculations also.

(sum, counts)

[1,40,10] = (51,3)

						= (51+79)/6 = 21.667
[20,50,9] = (79,3)
