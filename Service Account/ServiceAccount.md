# Service Accounts:

**A service account** is a special Google account that belongs to your application or services like  virtual machine (VM) instead of an individual end user. Your application uses the service account to call the Google API of a service, so that the users aren't directly involved.

A service account is identified by its email address, which is unique to the account.

Inside a Cloud project, Google Cloud automatically creates **one Compute Engine** service account and **one App Engine** service account under that project. You can create up to **98** additional service accounts to your project to control access to your resources.

### Types of service accounts
1. User-managed service accounts
    a. When you create a new Cloud project using Cloud Console and if Compute Engine API is enabled for your project, a Compute Engine Service account is created for you by default. It is identifiable using the email:
        1. PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
        2. PROJECT_ID@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
2. Google-managed service accounts
    a. In addition to the user-managed service accounts, you might see some additional service accounts in your projectâ€™s IAM policy or in the Cloud Console. These service accounts are created and owned by Google. These accounts represent different Google services and each account is automatically granted IAM roles to access your Google Cloud project.
3. Google APIs service account
    a. An example of a Google-managed service account is a Google API service account identifiable using the email:
        1. PROJECT_NUMBER@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com
    b. This service account is designed specifically to run internal Google processes on your behalf and is not listed in the Service Accounts section of Cloud Console.
    c. By default, the account is automatically granted the project editor role on the project and is listed in the IAM section of Cloud Console. This service account is deleted only when the project is deleted.


### Types of roles

There are three types of roles in Cloud IAM:
1. **Primitive roles**, which include the Owner, Editor, and Viewer roles that existed prior to the introduction of Cloud IAM.
2. **Predefined roles**, which provide granular access for a specific service and are managed by Google Cloud.
3. **Custom roles**, which provide granular access according to a user-specified list of permissions.

### Task Creating and managing service accounts Using gcli
1. To create a service account, run the following command in Cloud Shell:
    a. gcloud iam service-accounts create my-sa-357 --display-name "my service account"
2. Granting roles to service accounts
    b. gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID \
    --member serviceAccount:my-sa-357@$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/viewer

### Task Creating and managing service accounts Using Console
1. You will first create a new service account from the Cloud Console.
2. Go to Navigation menu > IAM & Admin, select Service accounts and click on + Create Service Account.
3. Fill necessary details with:
    a. Service account name: bigquery-demosa
    b. Now click Create and Continue and then add the following roles:
    c. Role: BigQuery Data Viewer and BigQuery User
